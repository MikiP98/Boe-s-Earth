# Boe's Earth

## Description

Boe's Earth is a mod that adds additional blockstated to couple of vanilla blocks.  
Those blockstates may be later used by shaders or resourcepacks to improve visual fidelity.

## Added blockstates

- `is_on_leaves`:
  Added to **Snow** and **Vines**  
  Snow on top of waving leaves will wave alongside the leaves  
  Vines supported by waving leaves will wave with them

## FAQ

**Q:** *Snow/Vines are not waving*  
**A:** *First make sure that your shader supports Boe's Earth, e.g. `Bliss`. Secondly, naturally generated blocks always have the custom blockstates disabled, they will however update with time. If you want to speed up the updating process, increase the `randomTickSpeed` gamerule, and decrease it back after to it's default `3`/`5`*

**Q:** *Forge version?*  
**A:** *The mod should work with Syntra Connector, though that is not a guarantee in the future*
